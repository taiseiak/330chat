Week of March 5th

Since we have gotten how the project is going to be organized with all our team members, we have gotten a lot of progress done on the project.
On the GUI side, the program now interprets the string and adds emotes automatically when appended to the message box. This is done
by parsing the string and looking for the specific sequence of characters that mean the emote. The part of the string is then replaced
by some html with a png file source. Next steps is to make it look better (the text is either above or below the png) and 
add more emotes, as well as other functionality such as sound.
