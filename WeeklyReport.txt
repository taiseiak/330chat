Week of March 5th

Since we have gotten how the project is going to be organized with all our team members, we have gotten a lot of progress done on the project.
On the GUI side, the program now interprets the string and adds emotes automatically when appended to the message box. This is done
by parsing the string and looking for the specific sequence of characters that mean the emote. The part of the string is then replaced
by some html with a png file source. Next steps is to make it look better (the text is either above or below the png) and 
add more emotes, as well as other functionality such as sound.

On the server side, a lot of time over this week was spent researching how Tcp sockets communicate and the implementation of
asynchronous vs syncronous servers. Currently committed to the branch server01 is an implementation of the basic server, which 
will be easily hooked up to the GUI via the Qt Tcp API. Currently the server imposes a blocking architecture on connections, 
but supports multiple connections, as has been tested. The ClientHandler is currently in progress to enable async 
communication as well as simplify the structure quite a bit so we can add our future functionality with ease.

We are also implementing file sending, and this week has been mostly figuring out how we are going to communicate from the server to the
client and implementing it on both sides. Until we have the server and client done, this part can't be completely finished, but 
so far the file sender's client side is essentially finished by connected by IP and port and creating a TCP socket to send the file across.
The next step is figuring out the rest of the server side and creating a file receiver on the client side, possibly to display images
or other files embedded in the gui.
