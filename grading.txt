Summary:
  + Strengths: 
	Reasonable design, multi client functionality 
	Good efforts by Taisei and Michael
	Emotes were an interesting addition
	Good presentation
  - Weaknesses:
	Only two team members' contributions are visible.
	The roject scope is significantly smaller than expected for a 3 or 4-person team. In terms of difficulty -- it's also not significantly different from many simple chat client-server examples out there (emotes are nice, but comprise a relatively easy addition).
